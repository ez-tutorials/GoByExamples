# [Golang Practices by Examples](https://gobyexample.com)
****

[Go](http://golang.org/) is an open source programming language designed for building simple, fast, and reliable software.
Go by Example is a hands-on introduction to Go using annotated example programs.

- [x] [hello-world](https://gobyexample.com/hello-world)
To run the program, put the code in hello-world.go and use go run.	

```sh
$ go run hello-world.go
hello world
```

Sometimes weâ€™ll want to build our programs into binaries. We can do this using go build.	

```sh
$ go build hello-world.go
$ ls
hello-world	hello-world.go
```

We can then execute the built binary directly.

```sh
$ ./hello-world
hello world
```
